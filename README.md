# Auction Bid

## Project Description
AuctionBid is a decentralized auction platform built on Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to create and participate in transparent, trustless auctions where the highest bidder wins the auctioned item. The platform ensures that all bids are recorded on the blockchain, providing a tamper-proof record of the auction process.

## Project Vision
Our vision is to revolutionize the traditional auction industry by leveraging blockchain technology to create a more transparent, efficient, and accessible auction system. By eliminating intermediaries and providing a trustless environment, AuctionBid aims to reduce costs, prevent fraud, and open up auction participation to a global audience.
